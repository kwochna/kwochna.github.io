Most of my work for this program has involved the competency of thinking critically and reflectively, especially regarding educational theory and practice. My discussion postings from the first and last weeks of EDCI 513, in which we were prompted to define the field of Educational Technology and to reflect on our understanding of the field, are one place where this is evident. A second is my game evaluation for EDCI 556, in which I analyze the educational video game *Lure of the Labyrinth* based on gameplay, user experience, and instructional value.

### Develops a personal vision of inclusive educational practice

My definition postings feature my contributions to two class discussions about our visions of education. The definition of the field of Learning Design and Technology that I gave at the outset of the course was,
> the systematic planning of materials and activities to facilitate learning and performance. 

 By the end of the course, I had revised my definition to,

> the systematic process of designing effective and efficient experiences to educate, train, and improve performance, using technological tools and strategies to optimize and individualize instruction.

My final definition illustrates a growing understanding about what is important for education. Added to my initial conception are the concepts of effectiveness, efficiency, optimization, and individualization. I apply my developing view of inclusivity in my evaluation of *Lure of the Labyrinth*. For example, I argue that the best feature of the game is that it is designed to be an inclusive education tool, since it can be played both individually and with others, both as separate puzzles or as a complete game, and both on its own at home and as part of lesson plans in the classroom.


### Describes the relationship between Educational Technology and the broader field of Education

My initial definition of Learning Design and Technology emphasizes the systematic nature of instructional design, while my revised definition stresses the optimization of learning and performance improvement. These definitions were informed by the connections I made between Educational Technology and other areas of education; in the first, contrasting my vision of Ed Tech with my experience as a college educator who works with K-12 educators, and in the second, reflecting on my new awareness about human performance improvement. In evaluating *Lure of the Labyrinth*, I elaborate on the role of this game, as a piece of technology, in a broader educational context:

> The great strength of *Lure of the Labyrinth* lies in the careful thought given to how teachers can implement the game in their classrooms. The creators have gone to great lengths to ensure that teachers will feel comfortable teaching with this game, even if they are not experienced gamers themselves.  

### Critically evaluates theory and practice

In my game evaluation, I use theoretical principles about play, motivation, game design, and instruction to evaluate the success of an educational game, identifying and exploring the overlaps and gaps between theory and practice. For example, I write:

>For some puzzles, the relevant math knowledge is evident and solving the puzzle requires at least implicit understanding of those concepts. These puzzles seem likely to support the intended learning objectives. However, some puzzles can be solved without using the corresponding math standards, and it is unlikely that a player would use the suggested math concepts if they were playing the game outside of a classroom.

In this observation, I am critical of the maker’s claim that learning is inherent to the game play, a factor that is highly relevant for  the effectiveness of games as educational tools.

### Thinking Critically and Reflectively: Personal Growth

Although my understanding of theory, practice, and the very nature of the field of Educational Technology have progressed substantially since the start of this program, experience continues to change my views. For example, my coursework in Human Performance Technology broadened my conception of problem solving in instructional design by helping me appreciate the non-learning factors that impact performance. This has enabled me to revise my classroom teaching to take better advantage of technology and to be more inclusive of learner differences. With every project I challenge myself to think critically, to reflect on my practice, and to re-assess my personal vision of education.
