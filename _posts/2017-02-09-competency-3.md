Evidence of my development of the competency of communicating knowledge can be found throughout my coursework for this program. One example is the final report for my group design project for EDCI 57200. Created in collaboration with two peers, this report details the instructional design process for a workshop, titled *Using Piktochart for Presentations*, to train middle managers to use the infographic software Piktochart to present information.

### Communicates effectively in oral and written formats

While developing the design project, my group mates gave me primary responsibility for composing and editing the report based on the strength of my writing skills. The report demonstrates my ability to communicate for varied purposes, from the narrative writing used to present the needs analysis to the concise and pragmatic descriptions needed for instructional objectives and test items. Although not recorded in the report itself, most of the collaboration for the project was conducted via conference calls, and I drew up my speaking skills to express complex ideas and maintain task focus over the phone.


To further illustrate the range of my communication skills, I provide the example of the poster on rapid prototyping I prepared for EDCI 51300. The objective of this assignment was to present a specific instructional design model as though it were a sign of the zodiac, including a visual symbol to represent the model and a description of the traits possessed by designers following it, or “under its sign.” My “horoscope” for rapid prototyping shows both my ability to adopt specific writing styles for different contexts (in this case, the style of a horoscope) and my ability to use graphics and visual design to convey content.

### Effectively communicates content through the design and delivery of teaching/learning activities that integrate content and pedagogy

My group design project final report presents a thoroughly designed workshop that efficiently combines learning activities for eight main instructional objectives and thirteen sub-objectives in just one hour. In a pilot test of six representative learners, 100% of participants reported that, “the objectives were clearly stated and met by the training", that "the training was well-structured and timed”, and that “the training was easy to understand.” The positive reception of this workshop reflects my ability to use instruction to effectively communicate content.

### Demonstrates the ability to adapt instruction and assessment techniques to the needs of diverse learners

Many design decisions for *Using Piktocharts for Presentations* were based directly on learner needs. For example, although our initial plan was to create an online course, the learner analysis we conducted revealed that our audience had little experience creating visual presentations and varied technical proficiency. We concluded that an in-person workshop would give us the greatest ability to assess individual progress and provide remediation while keeping the training concise, especially given that our learners were accustomed to face-to-face training at their organization, but we designed our materials to be implementable in a webinar as well so that the training could be adapted for learners with different needs.

### Communicating Knowledge: Personal Growth

Both of these artifacts are from early in my coursework. As a former academic and an educator, my oral and written communication skills were already strong, but my ability to communicate knowledge through the effectiveness and adaptability of my design has grown through experience with different projects. I continue to seek unfamiliar projects and to explore different mediums of communication with the hope that each new undertaking helps me to improve my clarity and my flexibility as an instructional designer.
