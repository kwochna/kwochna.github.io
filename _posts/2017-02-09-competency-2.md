My development of the competency of creating knowledge is illustrated in my final paper for EDCI 51300. This paper reviews the literature on forms of informal learning in the workplace, or on-the-job learning. The premise of the paper is that although most workplace learning occurs while working rather than during official training, organizations struggle to harness the power of informal learning because it is difficult to define, difficult to observe, and difficult to induce. In the review, I focus on best practices for using online communities of practice within organizations, since this is a popular and relatively accessible method of informal professional development.

### Demonstrates the ability to read and evaluate Educational Technology research

In order to provide a concise but thorough review of the literature on informal learning, self-regulated learning, and communities of practice, I had to comprehend and critique the existing research on these topics. In this paper, I synthesize the findings of more than twenty articles from major publications in the field, including *Human Research Development Quarterly*, *Journal of Distance Education*, and *Educational Technology & Society*.

### Demonstrates the ability to describe common research methods in Educational Technology

Although informal learning is inherently challenging to measure, I highlight various attempts to do so using common methods in the field. For example, most information about informal learning has been obtained by surveying workers about their own learning. I describe these contributions, but I also discuss the limitations of self-report methods, particularly for subjects about which people may not always have conscious awareness.

### Applies research findings to the solution of common problems in Educational Technology

I conclude the review by presenting a number of recommendations for fostering informal learning in the workplace and supporting productive and sustainable online communities of practice around workplace learning. One such suggestion is to legitimize community participation as a responsibility of the job and to reward knowledge-sharing behavior with advancement (as in, e.g., Boud & Middleton, 2003).

### Creating  Knowledge: Personal Growth

This paper was one of my earliest examinations of a topic in the field of educational technology; it reflects previously cultivated skills in academic research and writing but not a fully mature understanding of the addressed concepts. However, the topic is one of continued interest, and I was fortunate to have additional opportunities throughout my coursework to study informal learning and situated learning further, producing one of the major themes of my learning in this program. For example, I later developed an instructional module to help organizations increase informal learning by fostering critical reflection, and I plan to continue exploring methods for facilitating lifelong learning across contexts.
