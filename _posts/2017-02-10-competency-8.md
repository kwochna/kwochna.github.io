My development of the competency of applying computer-based technologies and media to the solution of instructional problems is illustrated in two large-scale projects. The first is the final report on my project for EDCI 56900, which features the digital prototype for the elearning module I created, *Passing the Academic Literacy Skills Test: The Extended-Response Item*, as well as a review of its design, development, and evaluation. The second is my evaluation plan completed for EDCI 57700, in which I propose a plan for how a fictionalized nonprofit organization could evaluate its use of another organization’s elearning course.

### Plans and designs effective learning environments and experiences supported by technology

The digital prototype of my online module, described in my final report, directly employed technology. I strongly believe that technology is a tool rather than an end in itself, and because I have worked in instructional environments with limited resources, I am aware that technology can also create barriers. By using sophisticated technology on my end (Adobe Captivate authoring software), I was able to develop an attractive and interactive product without imposing a technological burden on the organization or the end-users (the course runs in-browser using HTML5). The elearning design contributed to an ideal learning environment by mimicking the conditions of the computerized test it was preparing learners to take.

### Applies technology to facilitate a variety of effective assessment and evaluation strategies

The digital prototype used a combination of assessment strategies, from highly structured multiple-choice questions with direct feedback for early exercises to self-evaluation via rubrics and comparisons for the final essay assessment. However, assessment did pose a challenge in this project, since presently available technology does not permit automatic scoring of written essays. In my evaluation plan, I applied technology to propose a complete four-level evaluation based on Kirkpatrick’s model (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2006). In this evaluation plan, data are collected through a suite of online surveys, test assessments, emails, and website form submissions that make the steps of delivery, response, and analysis simple and efficient.

### Demonstrates understanding of social, ethical, legal, and human issues surrounding LDT issues and practice

Complex sets of issues had to be considered in both projects highlighted here. I needed to consider the social issues impacting my design, particularly the needs of my target audiences. The people who would be completing the evaluation instruments outlined in the evaluation plan were a diverse group of different ages and backgrounds, many of whom are not fully proficient in computer use. Therefore, a guiding principle in my process was that all tools had to be unintimidating and easy to use.

The audience for my digital prototype, on the other hand, was tech-savvy but extremely busy, so what was paramount in that project was flexibility: the ability to complete the course from anywhere, at any time, at any pace. Designers have an ethical responsibility to do what is best for learners, which I had to grapple with in this project. I believed that an ideal course on this content would use a human instructor who could give feedback on essays, but since the course was being created as a free resource for self-study, this was not possible. I had to figure out how to make the instruction effective in the absence of this important element, and focused on providing scaffolded and realistic practice that far exceeded what was previously available to these learners.

Because I work in non-profit educational settings, I have the advantage of more lenient copy permissions and fair use guidelines, which I used to incorporate some realistic examples into my digital prototype. Discussions with peers throughout this program have made me much more aware of the copyright and other legal issues that are common in commercial sectors. Finally, I support intensive user testing as a means of staying alert to the human issues around design. For example, a pilot test of my digital prototype identified a number of navigational difficulties that I was able to revise to improve user experience. This included an issue in which testers, without fail, attempted to close expanding windows that could only be opened. There was no reason why the windows needed to be closed, but I recognized that violating this instinct was negatively impacting their experience of the course, so I changed it.

### Applying Computer-Based Technologies: Personal Growth

As a face-to-face educator, my use of technology for instruction was minimal when I entered this program. I have now had the opportunity to use a variety of tools to support learning, including infographics, videos, screen captures, and more. I have learned how to better use my college’s learning management system and plan to continue incorporating more technology and media into my courses. I am currently designing and developing an e-learning course for my practicum in which I am applying and honing the skills learned through this coursework. One of my goals is to help the organization I am working with to improve their use of technology for learning. I also look forward to further cultivating these skills in my final course for this program, on the educational applications of hypermedia.
