-----
<p></p>

My final project for EDCI 53100 provides evidence that I have developed the competency of synthesizing knowledge. The objective of this project was to design a lesson that builds upon the principles of a learning theory or theories. I used the premise that knowledge is personally constructed and inseparable from context to propose an add-on instructional module. The module, titled *Incorporating Critical Reflection for Richer Learning*, aims to foster the skill of critical reflection, which I define as, “questioning and examining the influences and the consequences of our thoughts and actions.” The ability to reflect critically is explicitly required in many professions, such as medicine and teaching, but critical reflection can also increase the impact of any learning experience by engaging the learner in deep and personal inquiry. The module can be used whenever people have shared a potential learning experience (such as attending a training or collaborating on a project) to ensure that the experience results in meaningful and lasting change to thought patterns or behaviors.

### Demonstrates the ability to read and understand educational literature related to Educational Technology
In this project, I show my comprehension of professional writing within the field through a brief literature review on the theory of critical reflection, from Dewey to Schön, and its practice in professional education (e.g., Dewey, 1933; Schön, 1987). To create this review, I read and referenced a combination of books and articles from scholarly journals in education and organizational development.


In the literature review, I also explain the essential role that critical reflection serves within constructivist learning perspectives, particularly the theory of situated learning, which argues that people learn from interaction with others while completing concrete tasks in authentic environments (e.g., Lave & Wenger, 1991). I suggest that the situated view of learning is dependent upon some level of critical reflection.

### Applies knowledge of human learning, diversity and effective pedagogy to the solution of problems
Finally, I use the context of situated learning to propose an adaptable module that adds components of critical reflection onto any program of instruction or training. Through this project, I learned to create pragmatic instructional solutions that are directly supported by current research and to convey the theoretical underpinnings of instructional decisions in a succinct and accessible manner.

### Synthesizing Knowledge: Personal Growth
As a teacher of educational psychology, I was passionate about using theories of human learning to guide instruction when I entered this program. However, my coursework helped me to discover and engage with some theories that I was less familiar with, such as situated learning. As a result, every semester I have revised how I teach my own students about learning theories in order to bring my instruction more in line with theory. Though I still occasionally use strategies based on convention or convenience, I consider it part of my ongoing growth as an educator and designer to continually evaluate the match between my knowledge and my practice.
