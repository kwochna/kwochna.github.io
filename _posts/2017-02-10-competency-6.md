I consider myself new to the profession, so this program has been essential in helping me learn how to participate in the field. One example of how I have identified communities of practice is my group presentation on eLearning careers for EDCI 660B. To create this narrated slideshow, my group assembled and presented job listings, professional organizations, resources, and tools for elearning professionals to inform our peers about elearning as a career path. We also facilitated a class discussion about the elearning profession by posing initial questions and prompting our peers to share their ideas about professional participation.

### Identifies and participates in communities of practice within the field of Learning Design and Technology

For our presentation, I was responsible for collecting resources to share. I gathered materials, such as [62 Tips on Effective eLearning Instructional Design](https://www.elearningguild.com/publications/index.cfm?id=24), from organizations such as the [eLearning Guild](https://www.elearningguild.com/) and [eLearning Industry](https://elearningindustry.com/). I receive regular updates from both of these communities, so I chose to offer examples that I had personally used. 

### Participating Actively in Communities of Practice: Personal Growth

As a recent member of the [Association for Talent Development](https://www.td.org/) (ATD), I am looking forward to participating in the various conferences, workshops, and certificate programs they host. Future goals for professional community participation include getting involved with my local chapter of ATD, as well as learning more about the [Association for Educational Communications & Technology](http://aect.site-ym.com/) (AECT) and possibly becoming a member.
