My decision to join this program is the best evidence of my desire to continually learn and develop as a professional. Through my coursework, I have become not only more proficient in my current job as an educator, but also qualified to pursue careers in other areas related to educational technology. I reflect on my progress in developing instructional design skills needed in the reflection on expertise I composed at the conclusion of EDCI 67200.

### Demonstrates the disposition for life-long learning and continuous professional development

In the reflection, I self-evaluated my ability to find and solve problems across the four instructional design case studies that I had analyzed during the course. Although I judged my performance to have generally improved over the course of the class (not to mention drastically over the course of the program), I still identified important areas for growth. Primarily, I observed that my problem solving was very dependent on my familiarity with the context. One of my ongoing goals is to become more well-rounded as a designer. In my reflection, I describe my plan to do this by “gaining genuine experience through branching out in the types of projects I take on,” which will require that I continue to seek opportunities for professional development.

### Engaging in Professional Development: Personal Growth

This semester I am completing my practicum for this program. As I explain in my reflection, I believe this to be a key step in my professional development because it is my first time taking on a major project for an external client and in which I am neither the subject matter expert nor the instructor. I have already shared with the organization that I am willing to assist with additional projects as volunteer, in large part because I believe I will learn from doing so. As I transition to working as an instructional designer, I also look forward to taking advantage of the conferences, workshops, webinars, and certificate programs available to me. As one example, I am registered with [Designers For Learning](http://designersforlearning.org/), an organization that recruits volunteers for nonprofit design projects and that hosts service-learning courses related to instructional design. I have explored these courses previously, but plan to participate more fully in the future as a way of continuing my education after graduation.
