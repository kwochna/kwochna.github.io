## Learning Design & Technology Portfolio

Welcome to my academic portfolio, where you will be able to view samples of work created during my time in [Purdue University's Learning Design & Technology (LDT) Master's Program](http://online.purdue.edu/ldt/learning-design-technology). The contents of this portfolio indicate my mastery of the competencies required for graduation and for success in the instructional design profession. Works have been selected to highlight my progress and achievements, culminating in the degree of Master of Science in Education.
